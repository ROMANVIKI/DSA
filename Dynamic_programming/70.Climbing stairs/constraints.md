You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?



Example 1:

Input: n = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps

Example 2:

Input: n = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 1 step + 2 steps
3. 2 steps + 1 step


Approach 4: Space Optimization

Explanation: The space-optimized solution further reduces the space complexity by using only two variables (prev and curr) instead of an entire DP table. It initializes prev and curr to 1 since there is only one way to reach the base cases (0 and 1 steps). Then, in each iteration, it updates prev and curr by shifting their values. curr becomes the sum of the previous two values, and prev stores the previous value of curr.


Approach 3: Tabulation

Explanation: The tabulation solution eliminates recursion and uses a bottom-up approach to solve the problem iteratively. It creates a DP table (dp) of size n+1 to store the number of ways to reach each step. The base cases (0 and 1 steps) are initialized to 1 since there is only one way to reach them. Then, it iterates from 2 to n, filling in the DP table by summing up the values for the previous two steps. Finally, it returns the value in the last cell of the DP table, which represents the total number of ways to reach 

Approach 2: Memoization

Explanation: The memoization solution improves the recursive solution by introducing memoization, which avoids redundant calculations. We use an unordered map (memo) to store the already computed results for each step n. Before making a recursive call, we check if the result for the given n exists in the memo. If it does, we return the stored value; otherwise, we compute the result recursively and store it in the memo for future reference.

Approach 1: Recursion ❌ TLE ❌ 'TLE - In programming, "TLE" typically stands for "Time Limit Exceeded." It is an error or status message that indicates a program or algorithm took longer to execute than the allowed time limit.'

Explanation: The recursive solution uses the concept of Fibonacci numbers to solve the problem. It calculates the number of ways to climb the stairs by recursively calling the climbStairs function for (n-1) and (n-2) steps. However, this solution has exponential time complexity (O(2^n)) due to redundant calculations.
